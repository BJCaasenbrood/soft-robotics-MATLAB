# Soft Robotics MATLAB 


Soft robotics is a relatively new field of robotics with promising future applications. Yet, regarding traditional robotics, the field of soft robotics is still in the stae of inception, especially regarding modeling and control. Here, we (freely) offer code from MATLAB to model and simulate a soft robot manipulator.
